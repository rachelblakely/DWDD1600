<p>Rachel is a fresh graphic designer and artist who loves to create beautiful, colorful works. While Minnesota-born-and-raised, she's pleased to be based out of Utah Valley (for almost ten years, now)! She's been creating art and designs since she could first hold a crayon in her little hands and take great enjoyment out of turning her passions into a living. Have a seat and please explore her hand-coded site--we're so glad that you're here!</p>
